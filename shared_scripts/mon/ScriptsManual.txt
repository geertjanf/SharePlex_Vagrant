There are 8 scripts in total (4 more than those that comes after installation).

sp_capreadstats.sh – Capture and reader statistics (a csv file e.g. sp_capreadstats_2100.csv)
sp_speedofpost.sh – Post details information (a csv file e.g. sp_speedofpost_2100.csv)
sp_eventmon.sh – Monitoring for “warning/error” from event_log
sp_logmon.sh – How many logs is Capture behind Oracle log writer
sp_psmon.sh – SharePlex Process monitor (sp_cop, capture, read, export, import, post)
sp_qstatmon.sh – SharePlex Queue Status monitor

sp_mon.source.sh – Main monitoring script running on Source that will run the relevant scripts by passing in the necessary parameters
sp_mon.target.sh – Main monitoring script running on Target that will run the relevant scripts by passing in the necessary parameters


cron the two main scripts to run every hour (one on source and one on target)
and each of them will run their respective script.

sp_mon.source.sh
              sp_capreadstats.sh
               sp_psmon.sh
               sp_eventmon.sh
               sp_logmon.sh
               sp_qstatmon.sh
               
sp_mon.target.sh
               sp_psmon.sh
               sp_eventmon.sh
               sp_logmon.sh
              sp_speedofpost.sh

Things to do before running the scripts:
1)	Create a script directory on source and target to put the scripts 
2)	FTP all scripts over to server using ASCII mode and change all modes to 775
3)	Create a monitor directory on source and target to put all the output of the scripts + temporary files created by the scripts.
4)	Edit (vi) sp_mon.source.sh and sp_mon.target.sh script to change all environment variables
	a.	If you run more than one sp_cop on source/target, each sp_cop, you need to run one set of scripts
		i.   i.e. for source sp_cop 2100 you need one set of sp_capreadstats.sh and sp_qstatmon.sh
		ii.  i.e. for source sp_cop 2200 you need one set of sp_capreadstats.sh and sp_qstatmon.sh
		iii. the temporary files are all post fixed with their port numbers 
5)	You do not need to edit any of the other scripts, unless you want to enable email via mailx, they are currenty commented off
6)	The user can FTP out the csv files every day and they will be able to see the speed and volume processed (per hour) by SharePlex
	a.	sp_capreadstats_2100.csv
	b.	sp_speedofpost_2100.csv
